### This is LSC's source code! If you want the pre-compiled app, please go to this page: https://github.com/Hesterry/LSC

### If you intend to release your own version of LSC, in whole or part, please provide credit by linking to this page. Thank you!


### How Build the Project Files - Requires Unreal Engine v4.20 and Visual Studio

Simply unzip the files in a safe location, and run LSC.uproject. A window will appear prompting you to rebuild the LSC module. Click yes, and allow it to run - it may take a few minutes to complete.

While it's not required to run LSC in Unreal Engine's editor, you can also build the Visual Studio C++ files. To do this, simply right-click the LSC.uproject file, and select "Generate Visual Studio project files".


### Compiling From Source

Once the project files have been built, and LSC is open in the editor, you can compile a standalone version of LSC by going to File > Package Project > Windows > Windows (64-bit). This may take a few minutes to run.


### Where's the documentation?

Unfortunately, there isn't any at this time. If I happen to have time to write up some documentation for the source, I will do so - but that seems unlikely to happen. However, LSC is fairly straightforward, reasonably well commented, and shouldn't be hard to figure out. If you have any questions, please contact me via the LSC Discord.


### Donate

I've decided to discontinue the development of LSC, so I've removed the Patreon link within the app, and I'm no longer including donation links in my posts to Reddit and the BDO forums. However, if you still wish to donate to show support for my past effort, I've decided to leave these links here in the ReadMe. Thank you!

Last but certainly not least, a special thanks to my early testers, Eddit and Ryalin of Espers. You two made an incredible difference in the overall quality and development speed of LSC. Also, a big thanks to those of you who picked up LSC early, joined the Discord, and gave me your much needed feedback. Thank you, everyone :)
